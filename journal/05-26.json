So I am thinking we need a button within the loader that the user presses again to go to actually enter the level, I am thinking of calling it `Skip` or `Next` which will be disabled initially on load and then enabled once the asynchronous function has loaded the next scene. \n- Besides spending time on the Unity project, I decided to go back into the rs project which I believe I will go ahead and end for the time being. I will return to that aspect once I get a couple concepts clear up from my plate. I believe that I am spreading myself a bit too thin for the current amount of work and backlog.\n\n## Quote\n\n> I have not failed.
